# Nested Model for AI Design and Validation

Welcome to the **Nested Model for AI Design and Validation** repository! This project introduces a comprehensive framework designed to address the complexities of AI regulation and governance. Our model emphasizes trust, transparency, fairness, and the mitigation of discrimination issues in AI systems.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

The nested model consists of five interconnected layers, each addressing a specific aspect of AI design and validation:

1. **Regulation Layer**
   - Ensures compliance with existing regulations and ethical standards.
   - Serves as the foundational layer for subsequent design and validation processes.

2. **Domain Layer**
   - Focuses on the specific requirements and constraints of the domain where the AI will be applied.
   - Ensures relevance and effectiveness of the AI system in its intended context.

3. **Data Layer**
   - Addresses the quality, representativeness, and fairness of the data used for training and validating models.
   - Aims to prevent biases and enhance model performance.

4. **Model Layer**
   - Deals with the technical specifics of the AI model, including architecture, parameters, and interpretability.
   - Ensures robustness and reliability of the model.

5. **Prediction Layer**
   - Focuses on the accuracy and reliability of model predictions, ensuring alignment with intended use cases.
